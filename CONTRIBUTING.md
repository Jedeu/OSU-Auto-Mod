# Introduction

### Welcome!

First off, thank you so much for considering contributing to Auto Mod. Without the amazing OSU Online Post Bacc community, this project wouldn't exist!

### Why read this document?

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the students & developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Contributing 

Auto mod is an open source project and we'd love to receive contributions from our community! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Auto Mod itself.

# Ground Rules
### Behavior expectations

Responsibilities (To be expanded)
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See refer to the code of conduct [NEEDS LINK]

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Look for the `help wanted` tag!

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


# Getting started
### Submitting your contribution

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request and request a code review from a project owner 

# How to report a bug
### Security Disclosures
If you find a security vulnerability, do _NOT_ open an issue. Email mcbridej@oregonstate.edu instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, go ahead and email us! 

### Filing Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Node are you using (node -v)?
2. What operating system and processor specs are you using?
3. What did you do? (Can it be replicated?)
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Roadmap

The philosophy of this open source project is to provide tools for the OSU Online CS Post Bacc slack community and it's admins to better serve the community and it's purposes. Current features on the road map can be found in the `Projects` or `Issues` section of the Github repository. 

### Process for suggesting a feature.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

When you make a pull request, request one of the project owners to review your code. If the code review passes, your request will be merged. Any changes that are request from the reviewing project owner should be made to the same branch and pushed to the same Pull Request. Once changes are made, request a code review again. 

As with anything, do not hesitate to seek help or advice in the #Auto_Mod slack channel! Looking forward to your contributions!
