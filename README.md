The Auto Mod bot implementation for the OSU Online CS Post bacc slack community

## What dose this bot do?
Currently, the Auto Mod bot on the OSU Online Post Bacc CS slack dosen't do much. It tells the admins when a new channel has been created, and that's about it. We are looking to add a number of features to the Auto Mod in order to make our community more inclusive & dynamic as it continues to grow. This includes anonymous reporting, welcome messages, etc.
