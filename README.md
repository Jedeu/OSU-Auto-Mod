# OSU-Auto-Mod
___
The Auto Mod bot implementation for the OSU Online CS Post bacc slack community

## What does this bot do?
Currently, the Auto Mod bot on the OSU Online Post Bacc CS slack doesn't do much. It tells the admins when a new channel has been created, and that's about it. This project is an adaptation of the [Slack API terms of service bot](https://github.com/slackapi/template-terms-of-service) open source project. We are looking to add a number of features to the Auto Mod in order to make our community more inclusive & dynamic as it continues to grow. This includes anonymous reporting, welcome messages, terms of service signing, etc.
